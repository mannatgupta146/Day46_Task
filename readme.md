# Day 46 Task | Cohort 2.0  
This project is my **Day 45 Task**, where I built a **Download Progress Simulator** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

With a single click, a fake download animation begins, showing a progressing green bar, increasing percentage, and a button that shifts from **Download → Downloading → Downloaded**.  
This task helped me practice **DOM manipulation, timing functions, styling updates, and smooth UI transitions**.


## 📌 About the Day 45 Task  
Day 45 focused on using JavaScript timing functions and UI updates, including:

- `setInterval()` for progressive updates  
- `setTimeout()` for controlling total download duration  
- Updating **width**, **text**, and **colors** dynamically  
- Managing button states (enabled → disabled → completed)  
- Randomizing download duration for a realistic effect  

This task improved my ability to create **interactive loaders and progress bars** using JavaScript.

## ✨ Task Description  

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ⬇️ **Download Button** | Starts the fake download animation on click. |
| 📊 **Progress Bar** | Fills from 0% to 100% smoothly using JavaScript. |
| 🔢 **Percentage Counter** | Displays the increasing download percentage. |
| ⏱️ **Random Download Time** | Simulates varying download speeds with randomized timing. |
| 🎨 **Button State Changes** | Button updates from Download → Downloading → Downloaded. |
| 🧭 **DOM Manipulation** | Updates width, text content, and styles dynamically. |
| 🖥️ **Clean UI** | Centered, modern, simple user interface. |


## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure  
- **CSS** – Styling, layout, button UI  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Timer logic, DOM updates, progress animation  
- **VS Code / Browser** – Development setup  


## 📖 Learning Outcome  
Through this task, I learned how to:

- Use `setInterval()` & `setTimeout()` for animations  
- Create dynamic progress bars using CSS + JS  
- Modify styles (background-color, width, text) via JavaScript  
- Disable buttons and manage UI states  
- Add randomness using `Math.random()`  
- Build simple interactive UI components without libraries  

This task enhanced my understanding of **JavaScript timing + interactive UI design**.


## 🌟 Acknowledgement  
This task helped me grow in **frontend development**, especially in creating components involving animations, progress indicators, and timed actions.  
Thank you for the continuous learning journey through Cohort 2.0.
